# Project 2 – Suspicious Authentication / Repeated Sign-In Attempts Investigation

## Scenario Overview
Multiple authentication attempts were observed for a user account within a short period of time, prompting a review for potential unauthorized access or abnormal sign-in behaviour.

## Alert / Detection Trigger
The review was initiated after a pattern of repeated authentication attempts was observed for a single user account within a short timeframe. The frequency and timing of the sign-in activity were inconsistent with typical user behaviour, prompting further investigation to assess the risk of unauthorized access or abnormal authentication activity.

## Initial Triage – Authentication Review
Initial triage focused on reviewing authentication activity associated with the affected user account. Sign-in logs were examined to understand the volume, timing, and outcome of authentication attempts, as well as whether the activity originated from expected locations and devices. Particular attention was given to identifying repeated failed sign-in attempts, successful authentications, and any signs of abnormal authentication behaviour.

## Identity Investigation
The identity investigation focused on reviewing authentication behaviour in more detail to determine whether the activity suggested attempted account compromise. Sign-in logs were analysed to assess the consistency of locations, devices, and authentication methods used during the period of repeated authentication attempts.

Authentication outcomes were reviewed to confirm whether repeated failed sign-in attempts were followed by successful authentications, and to determine whether the activity aligned with the user’s normal sign-in patterns or indicated abnormal behaviour.

## Findings & Correlation
Review of the authentication activity showed repeated failed sign-in attempts followed by a successful authentication, with no evidence of unauthorized access. Sign-in attempts originated from expected locations and devices associated with the user account, and there were no unfamiliar IP addresses or authentication methods observed.

No sign-in events indicated elevated risk, and there were no account changes or follow-on activity suggesting credential compromise. The authentication behaviour was consistent with user-initiated sign-in attempts rather than an external MFA fatigue attack.

## Analyst Decision Points
These included forcing a password reset, resetting authentication credentials, or escalating the case for further review.

Given the absence of successful unauthorized sign-ins, unfamiliar locations, or elevated risk indicators, disruptive actions were not taken. The decision was made to continue monitoring the account rather than apply immediate remediation.

## Response & Decision
No immediate remediation actions were taken, as the investigation did not identify evidence of account compromise or MFA abuse. The user account was monitored for further abnormal authentication activity, and guidance was provided to report any unexpected MFA prompts promptly.

Incident Severity: Low

## Incident Closure
The incident was closed after confirming that the authentication activity did not indicate unauthorized access or abnormal authentication behaviour.

## Notes / Lessons Learned
Repeated MFA prompts should be reviewed in context. When no compromise indicators are present, monitoring may be sufficient.

## What Would Have Changed the Outcome
The response would have escalated if there had been evidence of successful sign-ins from unfamiliar locations or devices, repeated MFA approvals following failed attempts, elevated sign-in risk indicators, or account changes occurring after the authentication activity.
