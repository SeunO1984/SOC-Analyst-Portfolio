# Project 1 – Phishing → Identity Compromise Investigation

## Scenario Overview
A phishing email targeting a user mailbox was reviewed as part of a simulated SOC investigation. The message impersonated a legitimate service and contained a link intended to capture user credentials. The investigation focused on confirming whether the user interacted with the email and assessing whether any suspicious sign-in activity occurred after the message was received.

## Alert / Detection Trigger
