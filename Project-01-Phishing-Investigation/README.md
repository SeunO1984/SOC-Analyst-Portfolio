# Project 1 – Phishing → Identity Compromise Investigation

## Scenario Overview
A phishing email targeting a user mailbox was reviewed as part of a simulated SOC investigation. The message impersonated a legitimate service and contained a link intended to capture user credentials. The investigation focused on confirming whether the user interacted with the email and assessing whether any suspicious sign-in activity occurred after the message was received.
## Evidence Collected (Screenshots)

## Alert / Detection Trigger
The investigation was initiated after a phishing alert was raised for a suspicious sender domain and an embedded link commonly associated with credential harvesting. The email was flagged for review to assess potential user impact.
## Initial Triage – Email Analysis
Reviewed sender address and display name for impersonation indicators

Checked sender domain reputation and age

Analysed subject line and email body for urgency or social engineering tactics

Extracted and reviewed the embedded URL for redirection or credential harvesting behaviour

Confirmed whether the user interacted with the email or clicked the link

Checked if similar emails were delivered to other users
## Identity Investigation
Reviewed recent sign-in activity for the affected user account following receipt of the phishing email

Checked for sign-ins originating from unfamiliar locations, IP addresses, or devices

Looked for patterns of failed sign-in attempts followed by a successful authentication

Reviewed the authentication methods used during sign-ins, including whether MFA was prompted or bypassed

Checked for any high-risk or flagged sign-in events during the relevant timeframe

Verified whether any account changes or unusual activity occurred after the suspected phishing interaction
