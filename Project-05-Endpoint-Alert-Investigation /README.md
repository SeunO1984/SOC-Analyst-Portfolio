## Incident Summary
An endpoint security alert was raised for a user device after suspicious file activity was detected. The purpose of the investigation was to understand what triggered the alert, assess whether the behaviour posed a real security risk, and determine whether the device showed signs of compromise.

## Detection / Alert Trigger
The investigation began after Microsoft Defender for Endpoint generated an alert indicating that a suspicious file had been observed on a user device. The alert was categorised as malware-related with medium severity and required review to determine whether it represented a genuine security incident or a benign event.

## Scope of Investigation
The investigation focused on the affected endpoint, alert metadata, and associated process evidence available within Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. The review included alert details, evidence entities, and incident correlation data linked to the device and user.

## Alert Analysis
The alert details were reviewed to understand the nature of the detection, including the alert category, severity level, detection source, and detection technology. The alert was generated based on behavioural and machine learning indicators rather than a known malware signature.

## Process and Behaviour Review
Evidence associated with the alert was reviewed to identify the files and processes involved at the time of detection. Multiple files and processes were flagged as suspicious, including executable files and a dynamic link library. The observed activity did not clearly indicate confirmed malware execution or follow-on malicious behaviour.

## Correlation and Validation
The alert was reviewed in the context of the broader incident timeline. Incident data showed a multi-stage incident affecting a single device and user, with no indication of spread to other endpoints or users. No additional high-risk alerts were observed that would suggest a wider compromise.

## Findings
The investigation did not identify confirmed malware infection, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement. The suspicious activity appeared isolated to the affected device and did not escalate beyond the initial detection.

## Response and Outcome
No containment or remediation actions were required based on the findings. The alert was assessed as a medium-risk event that did not demonstrate ongoing malicious activity. Continued monitoring was deemed sufficient.

## Incident Closure
The incident was closed after confirming that the device did not show signs of compromise or active malware. The endpoint was considered low risk at the conclusion of the investigation.

## Lessons Learned
Endpoint alerts generated by behavioural detections should be reviewed carefully to distinguish between confirmed threats and benign or low-risk activity. Contextual review of evidence and incident correlation helps avoid unnecessary disruption while maintaining security assurance.
